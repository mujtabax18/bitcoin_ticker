## My Goal

The objective of this Project is to learn about using Cupertino and Material Widgets in parallel and providing a different user interface depending on the platform.


## What I have created

I had made a crypto currency price checking app. At end of the module, I am be able to monitor my bitcoin investents on the move!



## What I have learnt

- How to use the DropdownButton Widget from Material design.
- How to loop through code using Dart for and for-in loops.
- How to use Cupertino Widgets in your app.
- How to check the platform your app is being run on to customise the UI for that platform.
- Revise previous concepts by completing the challenges.
